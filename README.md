Hand Crafted Rules for user's intents in Banking domain.


### About

This is a pseudo-dialogue between user and bot, where the mission is to make annotations for user’s intents. If user’s message-input is in the repository then it is returned a dictionary with all information needed (depending on your will). If input is unknown then a message comes up to tell user “…type again”. Finally, the user says ‘bye’ or ‘goodbye’ etc. and the pseudo-dialogue ends.
